# :basketball:  Sports TriviaGame  :football:

Created during Week 5 of Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. The challenge was to create a timed trivia game. Each user is allowed 10 seconds to answer the questions. If the user guesses correctly then the site will display a success message. However if the player guesses incorrectly it will display the correct answer. At the end of each question a gif appears. Once the player has complete all the questions, the site will display counts all correct, incorrect, and unanswered questions. 

## Motivation

Homework assignment first and foremost but besides that I enojoy a variety of sports so I decided to make it a sports themed trivia game.
